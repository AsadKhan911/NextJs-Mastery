What is a Slug?
A slug is the part of a website's URL (link) that changes depending on what you're looking at.

 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you're on a blog website.
You visit this link:

https://myblog.com/blogPost/learn-javascript

The "learn-javascript" part is the slug.

It tells the website: "Show me the blog post about learning JavaScript."

In Next.js:
Next.js uses [square brackets] to create a dynamic page that can handle any slug.

/blogPost
  └── [slug] (folder)
        └── page.js
