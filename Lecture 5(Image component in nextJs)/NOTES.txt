In Next.js, the <Image> component is a powerful and optimized alternative to the standard <img> tag used in React.js. 

1. How Next.js <Image> Component Works:

Next.js provides the <Image> component via next/image:

import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/images/profile.jpg"
  alt="Profile Picture"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

Key Features:

Automatic Optimization: Images are automatically compressed and resized for different devices.

Lazy Loading: Loads images as they enter the viewport.

Responsive Loading: Generates different image sizes (srcSet) based on screen size.
