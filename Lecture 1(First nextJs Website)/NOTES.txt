Basic File/Folder Structure (in 2025 using App Router)

my-nextjs-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”œâ”€â”€ .next/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.js

1). app/ folder
ðŸ’¡ Think of this as your "pages and layout" area.

This is where you build your actual website pages.

You make folders like about, contact, etc., and put a file named page.js inside each one.

Example:

app/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.js         â†’ your home page ("/")
â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.js     â†’ the about page ("/about")
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.js       â†’ the layout shared by all pages
â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css     â†’ styles for the whole site

2). public/ folder
ðŸ’¡ A place to store images, videos, logos that visitors can directly access.

Anything you put here is available on your site directly.

For example:

public/logo.png â†’ shows up at https://your-site.com/logo.png

3). .next/ folder
ðŸ’¡ This is like the engine room of your site â€” created when you build or run the site.

You donâ€™t edit this. Next.js builds all your pages and keeps them here.
