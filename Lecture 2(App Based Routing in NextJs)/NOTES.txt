Note: Code in Lecture 1.

1). public/ Folder â€“ Purpose and Behavior (Then & Now)
What it does:
Files inside public/ are served as static assets directly from the root of your website. (pics,images,videos,files etc no .js files)

2). What is app based routing? (logic and .js files, web pages)

If you see in folder structure we have a folder named src\app , in this folder if we add any folder such as about , "src\app\about and in about we add "page.js" , it will become a route.

Eample: our folder structure "src\app\about\page.js" and when we write endpoint "http://localhost:3000/about" it will redirect us to about\page.js. This is nothing but app based routing.

3).Nested Routes: Nested route means such as "http://localhost:3000/about/team" , we will make it like this.

Suppose in src\app\about we make a new folder name "team" and inside team folder we make a file name page.js , so the whole structure become "src\app\about\team\page.js" and we can access it through "http://localhost:3000/about/team" , this is nothing but nested routes.
