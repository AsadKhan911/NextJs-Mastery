1. What is useRouter in Next.js?
ðŸ‘‰ useRouter is a React hook provided by Next.js to:

Navigate between pages
Get information from the URL (like query parameters or slugs)

EXAMPLE:

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  console.log(router.pathname); // current path like "/blog/[slug]"
  console.log(router.query);    // query object like { slug: "hello-world" }

  return <div>Current path: {router.pathname}</div>;
}

Example Use Case:
If you have a dynamic blog post page like:

/pages/blog/[slug].js

Then when you visit /blog/hello-world, you can get hello-world using useRouter:

const router = useRouter();
console.log(router.query.slug); // "hello-world"

 2. What is a Slug?
A slug is the part of the URL that identifies a specific page or item, usually in a readable format.

For example:

URL: https://myblog.com/post/hello-world
                      â†‘
                   This is a slug
